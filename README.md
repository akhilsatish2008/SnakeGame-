# The Snake Game 
In this project I created a game where the purpose is for the snake to eat as many blocks as possible. I created this game since it's an old classic that used to come stock on blackberry phones when they were all the rage and it was one of my faviorites üêç

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used Html and css for the display and JS for all my game logic. First I had to create a new board, a snake and the blocks required for its "food" that will be randomly generated on the board and finally the movement of the snake. I used the arrow keys and defined the movements based on my the clicks and also the boundries of the board. From their I just had to create a scoreboard and a function that would make the snake grow the more blocks it ate.

## Optimizations

I would like to increase the number of blocks for food as I m finding the game needs more action. Also to get rid of the alert when reaching 10 blocks of food.
Also make the snake movement smoother when turning.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me realize how much I actually love building fun little projects when I have time on the side. This also taught me how powerful just plain Js is and that you dont need a framework always for work around solutions.
